## General Instructions:

To begin, run the ASCII program and enter 1 to play with another human, or 2 to play with the AI. Please do not enter an extra space or enter invalid characters after any inputs.

When it's your turn, enter the coordinates of the piece you wish to move and the location you wish to move it to. The program will determine if that is a legal move, and if so, will make that move. Then, the AI or the other human user will make a move, and the game will continue until one player places another in checkmate. 

To quit the program at any time, please enter Control-C.
